Main Function:
	Prompt the user to enter commands.
	Read the input and tokenize it into separate commands, stored in an array.

For Each Command:
	If there's a pipe (|) character, set up a pipe for inter-process communication.
	Fork a child process to execute the command.

Child Process:
	If it's not the first command, redirect input from the previous command or file.
	If it's not the last command, redirect output to the next command or file.
	Tokenize the command string to extract arguments.
	If there are special operators like <, >, >>, or <<, handle input/output redirection accordingly.
	If it's a regular command, attempt to find its executable path and execute it using execve.
	If the command is not found, print an error message.

Parent Process:
	If it's not the first command, close the previous pipe's write end.
	If it's not the last command, close the current pipe's read end.

Wait for Child Processes:
	Wait for all child processes to finish before continuing.
