Run Function:

For Each Command:
	If there's a pipe (|) character, set up a pipe for inter-process communication.
	Fork a child process to execute the command.

	* Child Process:
		- If it's not the first command, redirect input from the previous pipe.
		- If it's not the last command, redirect output to the next pipe.
		- Handle redirection according to the input (`<`, `>`, `<<`, `>>`).
		- If it's a regular command, attempt to find its executable path and execute it using execve.
		- If the command is not found, print an error message.

	* Parent Process:
		- If it's not the first command, close the previous pipe's write end.
		- If it's not the last command, close the current pipe's read end.

Wait for Child Processes:
	Wait for all child processes to finish before continuing.
